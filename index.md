# ElMan23 GitHub Pages

Welcome to ElMan23 GitHub Pages!

## Background

I have a background in pure Mathematics.

I have some experience with pure research (I have a PhD); for some years I worked as a teacher, both at high school and at university (as assistant).

I currently work as Software Developer.

I have some experience with different aspects of software development, delivery, testing, system management.

My role gives me the opportunity to get some hands-on experience with:

- backend development (Java, Spring Boot);
- database management;
- deployment, containerization, CI/CD, DevOps practices;
- Linux system management.

## Interests

My interests in the field of Computer Science lie mostly in the following:

- Backend, API and algorithm development;
- Data Science;
- AI, ML & related;
- DevOps, DevSecOps, GitOps;
- Scripting and system administration;
- Cybersecurity.

## Technologies

Technologies I came in contact with:

- Java, Spring Boot, Vaadin;
- JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS;
- Python, FastAPI;
- Jupyter Notebooks, Jupyter Lab, notebooks (Kaggle, Colab);
- A little bit of Angular (mainly for frontend mantainment);
- PowerShell and Bash;
- Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm;
- GitHub, GitLab;
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, InfluxDB.

## Other Interests

What I'd like to learn / I am currently experimenting:

- Machine Learning: [Seth Weidman](https://github.com/SethHWeidman)'s [Deep learning from scratch](https://github.com/elman23/DeepLearningFromScratch), [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy)'s [nanoGPT](https://github.com/elman23/nanoGPT) and [Neural networks from zero to hero](https://github.com/elman23/nn-zero-to-hero);
- Rust programming languange: [Rustlings](https://github.com/elman23/rustlings) and [100 exercises to learn Rust](https://github.com/elman23/100-exercises-to-learn-rust);
- Go programming language;
- Python for API development;
- Kubernetes;
- React for frontend development;
- Android app development;
- Kernel stuff.

## Portfolio

I use the pretext of a "book app", since I like to keep a list of books that I read.

I try to experiment with a minimal entity configuration to focus best on the framework and the language. For example, a book may be represented simply by its author and title.

Some applications I have developed as a _base_ for additional freatures:

- [Spring Book App](https://github.com/elman23/spring-book-app): [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/) Spring REST API, it uses Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA.
- [Rust Book App](https://github.com/elman23/rust-book-app): written in Rust, REST API with PostgreSQL database.
- [Post App](https://github.com/elman23/postapp): [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (Python) project implementing basic "social media like post" functionality with authentication, users, database support.
- [Article API](https://github.com/elman23/articleapi): [Gorilla](https://gorilla.github.io/) (Go) REST API for articles with authentication and database support.

## Notes

Some interesting notes I wrote down (the result is quite quick and dirty):

- [Attention](notes/attention.pdf) for transformers, following [3B1B presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMlx5fFNoYc&t=269s).
